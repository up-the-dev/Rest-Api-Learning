# Rest-Api-Learning
In this application, I have build some of the most commonly used and important rest APIs using node.js and express.js and used MongoDB as a database.
While learning express framework, I built APIs for login controllers, registration controllers, JWT auth, input validations using the joi library, and so on, so #any suggestions for further optimization are greatly appreciated. 

You can get this code by copying the repo url and running "git clone <repoUrl>" in your local machine.
